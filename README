The goal of this project is to allow the creation of encrypted password hashes
that EXACTLY match those created by popular operating systems.  There are 
various existing projects that provide similar functions, most notably the 
powerful toolkit from Core Securities 

http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pshtoolkit.htm

In using this toolkit I noticed that it was not correctly creating the hashes
for passwords that included non-keyboard characters. I started writing some
code that seems to work and this is the result.  I welcome any feedback and
anyone who wishes to contribute.
